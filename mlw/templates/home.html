        <h1>Hack the Planet 2021</h1>
        <p>In today's world, climate change is much more than a vague threat â€” it's an ever-present reality. As
            humans continue to
            impact the environment and a related financial and technological gap persists, vulnerable populations
            are being hit the
            hardest and fastest. The planet needs our help!
            <br><br>
            Litter, plastics in particular, is accumulating in our seas and coasts. Information and data on marine
            litter is
            essential for tackling it.
